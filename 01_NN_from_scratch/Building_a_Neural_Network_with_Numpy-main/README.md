# Neural Network from Scratch with NumPy 🧠
This project implements a simple neural network using only the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) library in Python to recognize handwritten digit from [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset). The neural network is built manually, including phases such as optimization with gradient descent, forward propagation, and backpropagation.

## Theoretical explanation 📘 
For the theoretical explanation see the attached `.pdf`.

## Features 🚀
- Implementation of the neural network from scratch using only NumPy.
- Training functionality using gradient descent.
- Ability to predict output for new data once the network is trained.
- Flexible structure for the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer.

## Requirements 📋
- Python 3
- NumPy

## Installation 💻 (if you want to run it in local)
1. Clone the repository to your computer:
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash 
python3 -m venv venv
```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 📝
The `.ipynb` notebook it's ready for start, you just need to run it using your virtualenv or just upload it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
